Some notes on the SPI communication within the lower probe:

RPI is controller (master), ESP32 is peripheral (slave)

Buffer contains:
  Magic value (uint16_t)
    Always equal to 0xb0a7
  Magnetometer data:
    Heading (uint16_t)
      ESP32 returns actual measured heading (0-32767), RPI sends target heading (0-32767) or manual
      If MSB is set, propulsion is in manual mode. In this case, LS 8 bits in RPI transmission is propulsion duty cycle
    Camera pitch (uint16_t)
      ESP32 returns actual measured pitch (0-32767), RPI sends target pitch (0-32767) or manual
      If MSB is set, pitch is in manual mode. In this case, LS 8 bits are motor duty cycle, LS bit 9 is direction in RPI tx
      
  Lighting status:
    Current lighting duty cycle (uint8_t)
  
  DAC status:
    Current DAC output (uint8_t)
