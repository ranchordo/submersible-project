Some notes on the lower probe:

Functions, electronically:
  Camera
  Propulsion
  Lighting
  Camera pitch
  Magnetometer
  ESP32-RPi interface: SPI
  Upper probe comms

Tasks for the ESP32:
  Generate propulsion PWM
    Simple command to set target camera heading
    Closed-loop feedback control system with magnetometer input
    Important: Rapid failure detection - do not allow positive feedback
    Command to enable/disable manual override mode
      Simple command to set propulsion speed
      Reset to default (no motion) after ~0.5sec
  Generate lighting PWM
    Simple command to set
    Resets to default after ~1sec
  Control camera pitch
    Closed-loop feedback control system with magnetometer input
    Simple command to set target
    Important: Rapid failure detection - do not allow motor to spin freely
  Be available to send magnetometer data
    Simple command to query
    Camera heading and pitch (maybe roll for completeness?)
  Be available over SPI (necessitates command system)
  Generate DACed threshold signal for surface comms
    Simple command to set

Tasks for the RPi:
  Get, compress, and send video feed
    Add some gaps so upper probe can transmit
    "Blanking intervals"
  Relay some commands to ESP32
    Lighting
    Camera pitch and heading
    NOT: DAC tuning
    ALSO: Relay results (even just ACK)
  Deal with SPI
  Negotiate and search for proper threshold signal
    Quickly!
    Must be able to get upper probe to send known test packet
    Triggered by malformed packets or lack of rx
    Must only run so often (about once every second, max)
