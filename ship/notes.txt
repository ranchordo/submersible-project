  ESP32 (so, wifi and such)
  Propulsion (3 ESCs)
  GPS+GRPS (A9G with 1nce SIM)

  Forward some commands directly to upper probe
  Control heading
    Closed-loop feedback control system with magnetometer input
    Relay target heading to upper probe
  Keep up with heading and GPS location
    Send data when asked
  Do something cool with GRPS? Not sure...
  Spool control
    Allow steps in increments of markers
    Magnet at each marker
      Some weird control system can hold fixed position at marker
      Also can choose to skip markers
