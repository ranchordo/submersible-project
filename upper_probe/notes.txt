Some notes on the upper probe:

Functions, electronically:
  Lower probe comms
  ESP32 (so, wifi and such)
  That's it!

ESP32 is basically just a relay to short-range wireless, but with extra tasks:
  Send test packet every so often to keep the lower probe happy
  Watch for a command and send different test packet when received (quickly)
    Only for negotiations over DAC threshold signal on lower probe
